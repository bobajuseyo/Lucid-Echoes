# Lucid Echoes

**Lucid Echoes** is a **narrative-driven web game** themed around **dreams and self-reflection**.  
The game invites players to explore their **thoughts, emotions, and inner reactions** through interactive storytelling that unfolds across multiple choices and branching paths.

Players experience the story through **visuals, sounds, and decision-making**, where each choice shapes the **atmosphere, scene, and emotional tone** of the journey.  
Every path leads to unique outcomes, encouraging reflection on fear, memory, and identity within the dream world.
